# COMP535 Class Project - A Routing System

For this course we had a coding intensive project that involved creating a routing system. The first step was to create routers dynamically and then have them connect to each other in an arbitrary fashion. The routers communicated via Link-state advertisement. The link-state advertisement (LSA) is a basic communication means of the OSPF routing protocol for the Internet Protocol (IP). It communicates the router's local routing topology to all other local routers in the same OSPF area. When connecting them, you would set the neighbor as well as the weight of their connection. The rest of project consisted of using Djikstra's algorithm in order to efficiently guide a packet to a specified router in the network.

I got an A in this project, and did it singlehandedly even though it was recommended to work in groups of two or three.
